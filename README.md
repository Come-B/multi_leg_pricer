# PYTHON_PROJECT ## Authors : **CÃ´me Beaurain** : come.beaurain(at)mines-paristech.fr  **Luc-Henri Duval** : luc-henri.duval(at)dauphine.eu  **Alexandra Sadaka** : alexandra.sadaka(at)dauphine.eu## Installation : Required packages : pandas, bokeh, numpy, scipy.stats, arch, base64, io ## Running : ```bashbokeh serve --show PYTHON_PROJECT.py  ```## Interactive Interface Use : ### Overview Tab  : Product's (Portfolio) characteristics - Current spot value : slider to adjust the spot value - Legs : 	- click on the leg number you wish to activate (up to 4) - click again to deactivate	- set Total Quantity for each leg	- set Asset Type (vanilla call option/vanilla put option/spot) for each leg	- set the Strike for each leg (if Asset Type is call or put option)	- set Time to Maturity in days for each leg (if Asset Type is call or put option)- Intermediary value delay : choose the number of days after which you want to visualize the delayed product's valuation in the graph (should be lower than the maturity - turns red if the value is larger than the maturity of any leg)- Automatically Recompute : tick if you want to recompute automatically the product's valuation after any change in inputs - Recompute delay in ms : if Automatically Recompute box ticked - time the program waits before launching a recalculation after a change in inputs### Underlying Model Tab  : Choice between 4 Underlying Models - Days in year : you can choose between 252 or 365 days in a year- Available models :	- Black & Scholes :		- Resolution model : choose between Analytical (using Black & Scholes's closed form formulas), Monte-Carlo or Adaptive Monte-Carlo (experimental version which aims at running less simulations if the result reached at some point is deemed satisfactory)		- Parameters to input : daily risk-free interest rate r and daily volatility sigma	- GARCH(1,1) : 		- Resolution model : choose between Monte-Carlo or Adaptive Monte-Carlo		- Parameters to input : excess log-return bias mu, volatility bias omega, alpha, beta	- GJR-GARCH(1,1):		- Resolution model : choose between Monte-Carlo or Adaptive Monte-Carlo		- Parameters to input : excess log-return bias mu, volatility bias omega, alpha, beta, asymmetry factor gamma	- Heston : 		- Resolution model : choose between Monte-Carlo or Adaptive Monte-Carlo		- Parameters to input : annual risk-free interest rate r, v_zero, kappa, theta, sigma, rho- Optional (supported for B&S and both GARCH models): to fit a model for a given underlying asset, input file of the underlying's prices (in *.csv* or *.txt* format).If you used a file to fit a model and then want to use the same file to fit another model, you need to click on the choose file button, then cancel the file, and then re-upload it again. ## Interactive Interface Outputs ### Overview Tab : Product's Valuation (Portfolio Valuation)Table in the bottom left corner :  Price at Inception and Greeks  If underlying model is Black & Scholes :  - Computed Value : delta, gamma values computed with finite difference and theta value computed from the instantaneous value and delayed value  - Theorectical Value : values obtained with the  analytical formulas from Black & Scholes  Graph : Product's (Portfolio's) value with respect to the spot price  - Blue curve : Instantaneous value of the product (portfolio) (at date t)  - Green curve : Delayed value of the product (portfolio) (at date t + intermidiary value delay previously set)  - Red curve : Payoff at maturity  *(you can click on a curve's legend to mute it)*### Underlying Model Tab Top Graph : Underlying example path example (for the diffusion model of the chosen model)Bottom Graph : Volatility path example (for the diffusion model of the chosen model)
